            <p><h3>Newbie Programmer</h3></p>
            <p>I am currently a sophomore student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of Baguio. I am currently learning programming and coding along 
                with other specialized subjects related to my course. At the moment, I am facing challenges in coding due to issues such as slow typing, spelling mistakes, 
                difficulties in comprehension, and other obstacles. Finding the exact code I need to modify is really difficult, like super difficult!!! If I alter it, the entire 
                code will crash, but if I leave it as is, my work satisfaction will not be achieved. However, it remains enjoyable and demanding.
